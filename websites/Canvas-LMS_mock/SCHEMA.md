## State Management Architecture

### Dual-Layer State System

State is maintained on **two independent layers** that serve different purposes:

| Layer | Storage | Purpose | When Used |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Server-side** | `.mock-states/<sid>.json` + `.mock-states/<sid>.initial.json` | External state injection (RL training), `GET /go` from server | When `POST /post` is called with a `sid` |
| **Client-side** | `localStorage` keys `canvas_lms_state[_<sid>]` + `canvas_lms_initialState[_<sid>]` | React app runtime state, survives page refresh | Always active in the browser |

### State Flow Lifecycle

```
1. INJECTION (external agent sets state via API)
   POST /post?sid=abc → {"action":"set", "state":{...}}
   Server writes: .mock-states/abc.json (current) + .mock-states/abc.initial.json (initial, first write only)

2. PAGE LOAD
   AppContext mounts → checks localStorage for existing state (isRefresh?)
   ├── YES (page refresh): Load from localStorage, skip server fetch
   └── NO (fresh visit):
       ├── fetch GET /state?sid=abc → {stored_state, has_custom_state}
       ├── If has_custom_state: deep-merge server state with createInitialData() defaults
       └── If no custom state: use createInitialData() defaults
       └── Save to localStorage (both current + initial keys)

3. USER INTERACTION
   Component calls setState(updater) → React re-renders → useEffect persists to localStorage

4. STATE OBSERVATION
   ├── GET /go?sid=abc (server): reads .mock-states/abc.json vs .mock-states/abc.initial.json, diffs by top-level key
   └── /go route (client): reads React context state vs initialState ref, deep-diffs by path
```

### API Endpoints

#### `POST /post?sid=<sid>`

Manages server-side state files. Three actions:

| Action | Behavior | Body |
|--------|----------|------|
| `set` | Writes to current state file. On **first write** (no initial file exists), also writes initial state file. Supports `merge: true` for deep merge with existing state. | `{"action":"set", "state":{...}, "merge": false}` |
| `set_current` | Writes **only** current state file (never touches initial). Supports `merge: true`. | `{"action":"set_current", "state":{...}, "merge": false}` |
| `reset` | Deletes both current and initial state files. | `{"action":"reset"}` |

**Key distinction between `set` and `set_current`:**
- `set` — Use for initial state injection. Sets the baseline that diffs are computed against.
- `set_current` — Use for simulating state changes mid-session without changing the baseline. Only the "current" file is updated, so the diff reflects the delta from the original injection.

**Deep merge behavior** (`merge: true`):
- Objects are recursively merged (keys from source override target).
- Arrays are **replaced entirely** (not element-wise merged).
- Missing keys in source leave target keys untouched.

#### `GET /go?sid=<sid>`

Returns `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}` from server-side files.

- `state_diff` is computed **per top-level key** (e.g., `courses`, `assignments`).
- If a key has changed, the entire value is included under `modified` or `added`.
- If no server-side state exists for the sid, returns `{initial_state: {}, current_state: {}, state_diff: {}}`.

#### `GET /state?sid=<sid>`

Returns `{stored_state, has_custom_state, sid}`. Used by the client on initial load to check if external state was injected.

#### `POST /upload?sid=<sid>`

Multipart form data upload. Files stored at `.mock-files/<sid>/` directory.

**Request:** `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` with one or more file fields.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "url": "/files/<sid>/<stored_name>",
      "original_name": "homework.pdf",
      "stored_name": "a1b2c3d4_homework.pdf",
      "size": 12345,
      "content_type": "application/pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `GET /files/<sid>/<filename>`

Serves uploaded files with correct MIME type based on extension. Supported types: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.zip`, `.py`, `.java`, `.pptx`, `.docx`.

### Client-Side State Diff (`/go` route in SPA)

The client-side Go page uses `computeStateDiff()` from `stateTracker.js` which performs a **deep recursive diff**:

- Scalar values: reports `{old, new}` for each changed path (e.g., `"courses.0.color": {old: "#0374B5", new: "#EE0612"}`)
- Arrays: compared by `JSON.stringify` — if different, entire array is reported as changed at that path
- Objects: recursively compared key-by-key
- Null/undefined changes are tracked

This is more granular than the server-side diff (which compares entire top-level keys).
